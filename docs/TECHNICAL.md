# OmiVertex — Technical Documentation

*Audience: developers building, maintaining, or extending the system.*
*Last updated: 2026-07-10*

## 1. System overview

OmiVertex is Softility's internal resource-management system: it tracks associates
(consultants), the clients and projects they serve, and their allocations —
including billability, capacity, bench status, and roll-off dates — behind a
role-gated web UI.

It ships as a **single Spring Boot jar**: the React SPA is built into
`src/main/resources/static/` and served through one Thymeleaf shell template. There
is no separate frontend deployment.

## 4. Data model

```
Client 1 ──── * Project 1 ──── * Allocation * ──── 1 Associate
               │
               └──── * OpenPosition
```

| Entity | Key fields | Constraints |
|---|---|---|
| **Client** | name, industry, location, status (ACTIVE/INACTIVE) | `name` unique (case-insensitive check in service) |
| **Project** | code, name, client FK, status (ACTIVE/ON_HOLD/COMPLETED), startDate, endDate | `code` unique |
| **Associate** | name, email, company, location, workMode (ONSHORE/OFFSHORE), designation, joinedDate, resignationDate, lastWorkingDay, exitReason, status | `email` unique |
| **Allocation** | associate FK, project FK, billable (bool), allocationPercent (1–100), startDate, endDate (null = open) | see business rules |
| **AppUser** | email, name, role (VIEWER/ADMIN/ASSOCIATE), status (PENDING/APPROVED/REJECTED), associateId FK | `email` unique; backs the company-email sign-in flow |
| **SkillCategory** | name | `name` unique |
| **Skill** | name, category FK | `(name, category_id)` unique |
| **AssociateSkill** | associate FK, skill FK, proficiency (NOVICE, FOUNDATIONAL, INTERMEDIATE, FUNCTIONAL_USER, ADVANCE, MASTERY) | `(associate_id, skill_id)` unique |
| **Certification** | associate FK, name, authority, credentialId, issuedDate, expiryDate | — |
| **OpenPosition** | title, project FK, billable, allocationPercent, startDate, endDate, workMode, status (OPEN/FILLED/CANCELLED) | endDate ≥ startDate → else 400 |
| **PositionSkill** | position FK, skill FK, minProficiency, required (bool) | `(position_id, skill_id)` unique |
| **ProfileChangeRequest** | associate FK, type (SKILLS/RESUME), status (PENDING/APPROVED/REJECTED), skillsPayload (text), resumeFilename, resumeContentType, resumeByteSize, resumeContent (blob), note, decidedBy, decidedAt, createdAt | — |

**Derived, never stored:** an associate's `currentProject`, `currentClient`,
`billable`, and `benchDays` are computed from allocations at read time
(`AssociateResponse.from`). An allocation is *current* when
`startDate <= today && (endDate == null || endDate >= today)`.

Schema is Hibernate-managed (`ddl-auto=update`). For production-grade migrations
introduce Flyway before making breaking changes.

## 5. Business rules (enforced in services, all covered by tests)

1. **Uniqueness** — client name, project code, associate email → 409.
2. **No duplicate open allocation** — same associate + project with `endDate IS NULL` → 409.
3. **Capacity guard** — an associate is 100% capacity. On allocation create/update,
   the sum of `allocationPercent` across *date-overlapping* allocations
   (excluding self on update) must not exceed 100 → 409 with the computed total.
   Overlap: `!(a.end < new.start) && !(new.end < a.start)` (null end = ∞). Note the
   end date itself still counts as allocated — capacity frees the day *after*.
   **Import enforces the same guard** (2026-07-10): an over-capacity roster row is
   reported as a row error (the associate still imports; the allocation is skipped).
   One implementation: `AllocationService.assertCapacity` (package-private, annotated
   `noRollbackFor=ConflictException` so a bad row can't doom the import batch).
4. **Protective deletes** — client with projects, project with allocations,
   associate with allocations → 409. Delete order: allocations → projects/associates → clients.
5. **Bench** — associate with no current allocation. `benchDays` = days since the
   latest past `endDate`; if never allocated, since `joinedDate`, falling back to
   `createdAt` (2026-07-10: `joinedDate` added so roster imports don't reset the
   bench clock to the import day).
6. **Skill validation** — on associate create/update, any provided primary or secondary skill must match a recognized skill name in the taxonomy (case-insensitive) → 400.
7. **Exit auto-cleanup** (2026-07-10) — `exitReason` and `lastWorkingDay` must be set
   together (→ 400); `resignationDate ≤ lastWorkingDay` (→ 400). Once the last working
   day has passed, `AssociateService.processExits()` (nightly scheduler + inline when a
   past date is recorded) flips status to INACTIVE, ends open/later-ending allocations
   at the last working day, deletes never-started future allocations, and writes an
   `EXITED` audit entry. Idempotent.
8. **Position matching** (2026-07-10) — candidates need free capacity ≥ the position's
   percent. Full match = all must-have `PositionSkill`s at min proficiency + work-mode
   fit; ranked above partial matches, which carry `missingRequirements` labels. Order:
   full first, then must-haves met, nice-to-haves met, bench days desc. Positions with
   no structured skills fall back to legacy free-text headline matching.
9. **Self-service approval** (2026-07-10) — associate-proposed skill/resume changes stay
   PENDING (live data untouched) until an admin approves (applied through the existing
   services, so validation + audit fire) or rejects with a note. One pending change per
   (associate, type) → 409. Approving as ASSOCIATE requires a roster email match → 400.
10. **AI assistant** (2026-07-10) — `AssistantService` compiles a FULL-detail workforce
    context per request (`AssistantContextBuilder`: names, emails, skills, allocations,
    exits, open demand; resume file contents never included — user decision, see
    docs/TODO.md) and calls the vendor-neutral `GeminiClient` boundary; the HTTP
    implementation (`GeminiHttpClient`) is config-gated by
    `omivertex.assistant.gemini.api-key` / `.model` (default `gemini-2.5-flash`) and
    fails closed with 400 "not configured" when the key is unset. Message ≤ 2,000
    chars → else 400; history capped at the last 20 turns; upstream failures → 400
    with a readable message. Tests mock `GeminiClient` — the suite never calls Google.

## 6. REST API

Base path `/api/v1`. JSON. Session cookie required (see §7).

| Resource | Endpoints | Filters |
|---|---|---|
| `/clients` | GET, POST, GET/{id}, PUT/{id}, DELETE/{id} | — |
| `/projects` | same | `?clientId=` |
| `/associates` | same | `?workMode=&billable=&bench=&categoryId=&skillId=&minProficiency=` |
| `/allocations` | same (PUT uses `AllocationUpdateRequest` — no re-parenting) | `?projectId=&associateId=&active=` |
| `/positions` | GET, POST, GET/{id}, PUT/{id}, DELETE/{id} | `?status=&projectId=` |
| `/positions/{id}/matches` | GET (candidates ranked full-match first, partials labeled with what's missing; ADMIN) | — |
| `/positions/{id}/fill` | POST (fills position by creating an allocation over the position's start–end window, so capacity is consumed for that period and the end date feeds the roll-off radar; start defaults to today when the position has none; ADMIN) | — |
| `/staffing` | GET (client → project → associates tree from *current* allocations; per-level billable/non-billable counts, "billable wins" per client; ADMIN+VIEWER) | — |
| `/taxonomy` | GET (nested alphabetical tree) | — |
| `/taxonomy/categories` | POST, DELETE/{id} (ADMIN) | — |
| `/taxonomy/skills` | POST, DELETE/{id} (ADMIN) | — |
| `/associates/{id}/skills` | PUT (idempotent rated-skills replace; ADMIN) | — |
| `/associates/{id}/certifications` | GET, POST (ADMIN) | — |
| `/associates/{id}/resume` | GET (download), POST (upload/replace; ADMIN), DELETE (remove; ADMIN) | — |
| `/resumes/parse` | POST multipart `file` (stateless suggestion; ADMIN) | — |
| `/certifications` | GET (org-wide, alphabetical soonest expiry first) | `?q=` (search by name, authority, associate name) |
| `/certifications/{id}` | DELETE (ADMIN) | — |
| `/reports/skills` | GET (proficiency distribution tree) | — |
| `/dashboard/summary` | GET | — |
| `/data/import` | POST multipart `file` (.xlsx/.csv) | `?ignoreNovice=` |
| `/data/export` | GET | `?format=xlsx|csv|pdf|docx` |
| `/auth` | POST `/login`, POST `/google`, POST `/logout`, GET `/me` | — |
| `/admin/access-requests` | GET, POST `/{id}/approve`, POST `/{id}/reject` (ADMIN) | — |
| `/assistant/chat` | POST (natural-language Q&A over live workforce context via Gemini; ADMIN+VIEWER) | — |
| `/me/profile` | GET (own profile; ASSOCIATE) | — |
| `/me/profile-changes` | GET (own change requests list; ASSOCIATE) | — |
| `/me/profile-changes/skills` | POST (submit proposed skills; ASSOCIATE) | — |
| `/me/profile-changes/resume` | POST multipart `file` (submit proposed resume; ASSOCIATE) | — |
| `/profile-changes` | GET (review queue; ADMIN+VIEWER) | `?status=` |
| `/profile-changes/{id}/approve` | POST (approve change request; ADMIN) | — |
| `/profile-changes/{id}/reject` | POST (reject change request with note; ADMIN) | — |

**Error contract** (from `GlobalExceptionHandler`):

```json
{ "message": "…", "fieldErrors": { "field": "reason" } }
```

- 400 validation (`fieldErrors` populated) or bad input file
- 401 not signed in / bad credentials
- 403 viewer attempting a write ("Your account is read-only")
- 404 unknown id
- 409 uniqueness, capacity, duplicate-allocation, protective-delete conflicts

**`/dashboard/summary` response shape** (all computed live; every KPI counts
**ACTIVE associates only** — INACTIVE leavers and their lingering allocations are
excluded from headcounts, bench, and utilization; the historical `staffingTrend`
is the one series that keeps past allocations regardless of current status):

```
totalAssociates, billableCount, nonBillableCount, benchCount,
onshoreCount, offshoreCount, totalClients, activeProjects,
utilizationPercent            // FTE-weighted: Σ min(billable %,100) / associates
benchAging { days0to30, days31to60, days60plus }
benchAssociates [ { id, name, designation, benchDays } ]   // sorted desc
upcomingRolloffs [ { allocationId, associateId, associateName,
                     projectName, clientName, endDate, daysLeft } ]  // ≤30 days
clientHeadcounts [ { clientName, headcount } ]
staffingTrend    [ { month, total, billable } ]             // trailing 6 months
expiringCertifications [ { certificationId, associateId, associateName, name, expiryDate, daysLeft } ] // ≤90 days
exitsLast12Months             // leavers with lastWorkingDay in the trailing 365 days
skillGaps [ { skillId, skillName, category, demand, benchSupply, totalSupply, gap } ]
                              // per must-have skill on OPEN positions; supply counted at the
                              // lowest demanded proficiency; sorted by gap desc, ≤20 rows
utilizationForecast [ { label, percent } ]   // Today/+30d/+60d/+90d, deterministic from
                              // known allocation end dates + recorded exits
```

## 7. Security

Two sign-in paths coexist:

1. **Built-in accounts** (in-memory, `SecurityConfig`): `admin` → ROLE_ADMIN,
   `viewer` → ROLE_VIEWER. Passwords default to `Admin@123` / `Viewer@123`;
   override with `omivertex.auth.admin-password` / `omivertex.auth.viewer-password`.
2. **Company-email sign-in with approval workflow** (`POST /api/v1/auth/google`,
   `AppUser` entity): only `@softility.com` addresses are accepted. First sign-in
   creates an `AppUser` with status PENDING and role VIEWER; the user is refused
   with "pending approval" until a Super Admin approves them under
   **Access Requests** (`/api/v1/admin/access-requests` — list, `/{id}/approve`,
   `/{id}/reject`; ADMIN-only, admin-only sidebar entry in the SPA). Approved
   users authenticate by email; REJECTED users are refused.
   *Note: this endpoint currently trusts the client-supplied email/name — wire it
   to real Google ID-token verification before exposing beyond the intranet.*

- **Authorization**: `/api/v1/auth/login` and `/api/v1/auth/google` are public;
  `/api/v1/admin/**` needs ADMIN; `GET /api/v1/**` needs any role; **all other
  methods on `/api/v1/**` need ADMIN**. Static assets and the shell are public
  (the SPA itself gates on `/auth/me`).
- Session-based (`HttpSessionSecurityContextRepository` saved explicitly in
  `AuthController.login`). CSRF is disabled (internal tool, JSON API). Entry
  point/denied handler return JSON 401/403 instead of redirects.
- Frontend: `api.js` dispatches `ov-unauthorized` on any 401 → `App` drops to the
  login page. `canEdit` (`role === 'ADMIN'`) is passed to every page to hide
  mutation UI — **the server remains the actual enforcement point**.

## 8. Import / export

**Import** (`ImportService`): accepts `.xlsx` (POI) or `.csv` files. It supports two modes:

1. **Legacy Single-Sheet / CSV Import**:
   Reads the active sheet. Header names matched case-insensitively: `ASSOCIATE NAME, COMPANY, LOCATION, CUSTOMER, BILLABLE, PROJECT, JOINED DATE` (aliases: NAME/CLIENT/WORK MODE/SHORE/BILLING/JOIN DATE/DATE OF JOINING/DOJ). `JOINED DATE` is optional and anchors the bench clock for never-allocated associates.
   - Email is generated as `first.last@softility.com` (idempotency key).
   - Client and project are found-or-created.
   - Allocation created at 100% starting today — subject to the capacity guard
     (business rule 3): an over-capacity row becomes a row error, the associate
     still imports, and the allocation is not created.

2. **Multi-Sheet Excel Workbook Import (v2)**:
   Triggered if the workbook contains a sheet named `Employees`. It reads three sheets:
   - **`Employees`**: Columns `Name, Email, Designation, Company, Location, Work Mode` (Shore).
   - **`EmployeeSkills`**: Columns `Email, Category, Skill, Proficiency` (mapped to `Proficiency` enum). Accepts query parameter `?ignoreNovice=true` to skip importing "Novice" rated skills.
   - **`Certifications`**: Columns `Email, Name, Authority, Credential ID, Issued Date, Expiry Date`.

Per-row failures are collected into `errors[]` and do not abort the batch. Returns `ImportSummaryResponse` (counts of records imported/skipped + error details).

**Export** (`ExportService`): renders the associate roster (with derived fields)
to xlsx (POI, styled header), csv, pdf (OpenPDF, landscape A4, zebra table), or
docx (POI XWPF). Returned as `attachment` with correct MIME type.

## 9. Frontend architecture

- **No router library**: `useHashRoute()` in `App.jsx` maps `#/path` → page
  component from a `ROUTES` table. Deep links work.
- **Auth gate**: `App` calls `/auth/me` on mount; `undefined` = checking (renders
  nothing), `null` = login page, object = shell. Logout and global 401s reset it.
- **Theming**: CSS custom properties on `:root` and `[data-theme='dark']`
  (`styles.css`). `theme.js` persists light/dark/system in
  `localStorage['ov-theme']`; both HTML shells run a pre-paint inline script to
  avoid theme flash. **Never hardcode colors in components — use the tokens.**
- **Charts** (`components/charts.jsx`): hand-rolled SVG. `TrendChart` (line,
  crosshair + all-series tooltip), `DonutChart`, `VBarChart`, `StackedBar`,
  `HBarChart`. Series colors come from `--chart-1..5`, validated against both
  surfaces (see `docs/superpowers/` dataviz notes). framer-motion drives entrance
  springs and hover states; every animation respects `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- **Role gating**: pages receive `canEdit`; mutation buttons and `DataTable`'s
  edit/delete column render only when true.
- **Toasts / errors**: field errors from the API map 1:1 onto form fields via
  `err.fieldErrors`; general failures surface in a form alert or toast.

## 10. Build, run, develop

```bash
# prerequisites: Java 21, Node 18+, PostgreSQL with database "omivertex"
cd frontend && npm install && npm run build && cd ..   # SPA → static/
./mvnw spring-boot:run                                  # http://localhost:8080
./mvnw test                                             # 94 tests
cd frontend && npm run dev                              # Vite on :5173, /api proxied
```

- `npm run build` outputs to `frontend/dist/` with stable asset names
  (`assets/app.js|css`). A `maven-resources-plugin` execution copies `dist/`
  into `target/classes/static/` at `process-resources` — excluding Vite's
  `index.html`, so the Thymeleaf shell stays canonical for `/`. The bundle never
  lives under `src/`, keeping git and the graphify knowledge graph clean.
- Seeding: `SeedDataLoader` runs when `omivertex.seed=true` **and the clients
  table is empty** (idempotent). Disable in properties for a clean start.
- Packaging: `./mvnw package` → single runnable jar (build the frontend first).

## 11. Testing conventions

- All tests are **HTTP-level** (`@SpringBootTest + MockMvc`) in
  `src/test/java/…/api/`, running on H2 in PostgreSQL mode — no database needed.
- `ApiTestBase` provides entity factory helpers, a clean-DB `@BeforeEach`
  (delete order matters), and class-level `@WithMockUser(roles="ADMIN")`.
  `AuthApiTest` exercises real logins with `MockHttpSession` instead.
- The project is built **strictly TDD**: write the failing test first, watch it
  fail for the right reason, implement to green. Every business rule in §5 has
  both a happy-path and a conflict test. Current suite: **94 tests**.

## 12. Known limitations / next steps

- Company-email sign-in does not yet verify a Google ID token — it trusts the
  posted email/name. Add real OAuth/OIDC verification before wider rollout.
- Built-in accounts remain in-memory; access-request flow has no test coverage yet.
- No pagination — list endpoints return everything (fine ≤ ~1k rows).
- No audit trail or optimistic locking (`@Version`).
- Hibernate-managed schema; adopt Flyway before schema-breaking changes.
- Import treats generated email as identity; a real email column in the sheet
  should take precedence if added.
